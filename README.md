This is [Moltony](https://github.com/IAmMoltony)'s oldest GitHub account.

### some history

In 2020, I wanted to host a C++ game called "Eat Simulator", and as such I created this account and a repo, but I forgot about it real soon. Then, recently, I decided to check up on my old accounts, and saw the game's repo. The repo contained only a README with some really broken english and a default gitignore file, so no game code or anything. And today (Jan 1st, 2024) I deleted it.

### any future???

No, this account will just sit here for no reason whatsoever.
